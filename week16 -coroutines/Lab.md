# Coroutine Lab

## Objective

During the lab you may want to consider how you could use `co-routines` instead of `Threads` for making networking requests in Android.

If you've not already done so, start to think about the `API` you plan to consume for your assignnent, and perhaps try and build a basic application to retrieve some data from it - you could try both a `thread` and `co-routine` based approach.
